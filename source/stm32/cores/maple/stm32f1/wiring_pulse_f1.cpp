/* Measures the length (in microseconds) of a pulse on the pin; state is HIGH
 * or LOW, the type of pulse to measure.  Works on pulses from 2-3 microseconds
 * to 3 minutes in length, but must be called at least a few dozen microseconds
 * before the start of the pulse. */

  *
  * Note. The API spec for this function published on http://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/PulseIn 
  * doesn't reflect what either the AVR or SAM version of this function actualy do with regard to the timeout value
  *
  * "timeout (optional): the number of microseconds to wait for the pulse to start; default is one second (unsigned long) "
  *
  * Because the timeout, is actually coded as the total time to both wait while the input is in the state requested
  * then wait for the opposite state duration
  * then count the length of the pulse when it has the value of state (HIGH or LOW)
  * 
  * So I think the code for both the AVR and the Due is wrong in that it doesnt match the spec
  * 
  * I have done basically the same as the AVR and Due code, except to make the timeout a bit more accurate I have put in a dummy volatile varable 
  * dummyWidth so that both the waiting while loops take the same number of clock cycles to execute as the acount width counting loop
  *
  * to be slighly more accurate the maxLoops variable really needs to take into account the loop setup code, but its probably as good as necessary
